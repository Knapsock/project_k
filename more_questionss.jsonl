{"question": "What is B.O.D. and why is it important?", "answer": "B.O.D. stands for Biochemical Oxygen Demand. It measures the amount of oxygen that microorganisms need to break down organic matter in water. A higher B.O.D. indicates more pollution and less oxygen available for aquatic life."}
{"question": "What is the function of a turbo-blower?", "answer": "A turbo-blower supplies compressed air to the engine or process systems. It's used to enhance combustion efficiency and maintain system pressure."}
{"question": "How can carbon deposits affect exhaust gas turbo-blowers?", "answer": "Carbon deposits can reduce efficiency by clogging the internal surfaces, increasing exhaust gas temperatures, and decreasing engine performance."}
{"question": "How are carbon deposits removed from turbo-blowers?", "answer": "Deposits are removed through turbine side cleaning, which involves lowering the engine speed and flushing with fresh water."}
{"question": "What are the signs of water leakage in a turbocharger casing?", "answer": "Signs include triggering of the Main Engine Cooling Water Header Tank Low Level alarm and excessive water discharge from the turbocharger drain."}
{"question": "How can you prevent debris from entering the scavenging system?", "answer": "By using the upper stuffing box section as a barrier to separate the scavenging air from the crankcase, preventing contamination."}
{"question": "Why is maintaining oxygen levels in water critical?", "answer": "Low oxygen levels harm aquatic organisms. Maintaining adequate oxygen is essential for healthy water ecosystems and to prevent eutrophication."}
{"question": "What is the role of centrifugal brakes in machinery?", "answer": "Centrifugal brakes slow down or stop rotating equipment by using centrifugal force to engage braking components, improving operational safety."}
{"question": "What does high B.O.D. indicate about water quality?", "answer": "A high B.O.D. means the water contains a lot of organic waste, leading to reduced oxygen levels which can harm aquatic life."}
{"question": "What is the importance of regularly checking exhaust gas systems?", "answer": "Regular checks ensure there are no blockages or efficiency losses, preventing overheating, fuel waste, and engine damage."}
