1. Q: What is the PDF all about?
A: The PDF is about maintaining and operating hydraulic systems, specifically fire extinguishers and other machinery on ships. It covers documentation, spare parts, and testing procedures to ensure proper function and safety.

2. Q: Describe the nature and the possible effects on machinery operation of deposits, which may adhere to the internal surfaces of exhaust gas turbo-blowers and explain how these deposits are removed.
A: Deposits like carbon and soot can adhere inside exhaust turbo-blowers, reducing turbo efficiency and power output. They're removed via turbine side cleaning â€” reducing engine speed and flushing with fresh water.

3. Q: Can you give me a diagrammatic representation of this?
A: No, the context does not relate to sea water cooling systems or diagrams. It discusses deflection measurements, which don't support diagrammatic representation.

4. Q: What is the relationship between BOD and centrifugal brakes?
A: There is no direct relationship between biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and centrifugal brakes.
